Syntac demands for binary operators:
- Basic operations are repsented by conventional mathematical operators, unless these are ambiguious.
- Commutative operators are represented by infix symmetric symbols
- Non commutative operators are represented by asymetric infix symbols
- A conventional system of operator presedences prevents superfluous use of enclosures
- Associative operators do not require enclosures


Example functions:
	- Average (functions)
	- Division algorithm, extended Euclidean algorithm (multiple return values)
	- Factorial, Ackermann (recursion)
	- Numerical differentiation (first class functions + closures)
	- Symbolic differentiation (reflection)
	- I/O: "Name?" <name> "Hello <name>!"
	- Structures: make_complex(a,b) add_complex(a,b) mul_complex(a,b)
	- Bottles of beer
	- Trabb_Pardo-Knuth_algorithm

Derive f x ↦ fx
	arguments returns ≔ arity f
	arg1 ≔ arg f 1
	ret1 ≔ ret f 1

Symbol → closure with 0 inputs and 0 outputs

function Derive(function f, variable x)
{
	if f = c      return 0
	if f = x      return 1
	if f = a + b  return Derive(a, x) + Derive(b, x)
	if f = a * b  return Derive(a, x) * b + a * Derive(b, x)
	if f = a / b  return (Derive(a, x) * b + a * Derive(b, x)) / (b ^ 2)
	if f = a ^ b  return Derive(exp(ln(a) * b), x)
	if f = sin(a) return cos(a) * Derive(a, x)
	if f = cos(a) return -sin(a) * Derive(a, x)
	if f = exp(a) return exp(a) * Derive(a, x)
	if f = ln(a)  return Derive(a, x) / a
	if f = a(b)   return Derive(a(x), x)(b) * Derive(b, x)

== Iterators ==

Consider an itterator with a state n that produces squares:

	itterate n ↦ (n ^ 2) (n + 1)

such that

	a0 next ≔ itterate 0
	a1 next' ≔ itterate next
	a2 next"' ≔ itterate next'
	…

== Iterators with state in closure ==

Can we save the state internally in a closure? i.e. can we construct a closure such that:

	a0 next ≔ begin
	a1 next' ≔ next
	a2 next" ≔ next'
	a3 next"' ≔ next"
	…

begin ↦ a0 next
	a0 state ≔ itterate 0
	next ↦ a1 next'
		a1 state' ≔ itterate state
		next' ≔ next-with-state-bound-to-"state'"

To implement this one would need a reflection construct that allows rebinding of externals, i.e. modifying closures.

= Unconditional control flow =

Representation of a function application with three inputs and two outputs:

         ↑   ↑
   → o——————————
       ↑   ↑   ↑

Definition of a function with three inputs and two outputs:

       ↑   ↑   ↑
   ← o——————————
         ↑   ↑

The representation of recursion is now trivial: the output of the function definition is used inside the function body.

= Conditional control flow =

The representation of conditional flow control is less trivial. First of all, given recursion any flow-control construct can be implemented using only one flow-control construct such as an if statement or a loop (structured program theorem). The if statement can be represented by a function:

            ↑
 if → o——————————
        ↑   ↑   ↑

Where the first input is the condition, and maps to some boolean type, the second input is the expression-when-true and the last input is the expression-when-false. Either the first or last expression is returned on the output.

= Correct if =

The "if" function as defined above requires special treatment compared to a normal function; it's argument must be evaluated lazily. This special treatment can be removed if we demand the second and third arguments to be functions taking no inputs and having one output. That is, we make the following transformation:

	result ≔ if condition expr_then expr_else

to

	restult ≔ if condition func_then func_else
	func_then ↦ expr_then
	func_else ↦ expr_else

Where the if function would evaluate and return either the first or the second expression, depending on the condition. The "if" is now an ordinary function.

However, this reveals a more general problem; which function calls are part of the function body (to be executed on every evaluation) and which are part of the definition (to be evaluated once on declaration).

One strategy would be to minimize the function body (resulting in fast functions). This can be done by evaluating everything that does not depend on an input and replacing it by the result.

But this would mean that functions returning constants are evaluated at compile time and have their body replaced by the constant. This is not always what we want, for example, this would defeat the lazy evaluation of expr_then, since it would get evaluated when defining func_then.

Question: There is an obvious minimal function body, given by causal relations between inputs and outputs. Is there a maximal function body?
Answer: No, we can always invent a new function taking no inputs and outputs, and include it in the body. However, this only changes the program if functions can have side effects (or consume time, for that matter)

TODO: Resolve this problem in the most elegant way.

== Virtual arrows ==

One solution would be to explicitely specify which function calls should be included in which function bodies and we could explicitely order the function calls within a function order. Both of these would prevent certain optimizations however.

Perhaps we should allow the programmer to define a partial order on the instructions. It would be best if this could somehow also include the notion of including and excluding a function from a function body.

This can be implemented by allowing the user to include additional artificial dependencies in the program graph. These are drawn using dotted arrows.

      ↑   ↑   ↑   ⇡
   ← o—————————————
        ↑   ↑   ⇡

Note that whereas multiple artificial inputs can be necesarry, there is never a need for more than one artificial output.

A textual syntax can defined as follows:

Call:		<output 1> <output 2> <etc…> ; <artificial output> ≔ <input 1> <input 2> <etc…> ; <artificial input 1> <etc…>
Defn:		<argument 1> <argument 2> <etc…> ; <artificial argument 1> <etc…> ↦ <return 1> <return 2> <etc…> ; <artificial return>

o1 o2 ; ao ≔ i1 i2 ; ai1 ai2

= Examples =

A function doing absolutely nothing: e ↦
This is how constants can be defined
A function returning itself: c ↦ c

A function calculating the average of two parameters (given the functions add, div and two):

avg a b ↦ r
	sum ≔ add a b
	r ≔ div r two

Or with a little syntax suggar:

avg a b ↦ r
	r ≔ (a + b) / 2


only evaluate f after z is calculated:
y ≔ f x ; z

two function f and g taking no inputs or outputs, but must be invoked in that order:

; o ≔ f
≔ g ; o

The function h (no inputs, no outputs) calls f and g (no specific order)

h ; hi ↦ ; of og
; of ≔ f ; hi
; og ≔ g ; hi

hi ensures they can not be called untill h is called (prevents them from being replaced by constants)
ho ensures that they need to be called before h returns (prevents dead code ellimination)


The functions f, g and should be called before h and after k:

≔ k ; ok
; of ≔ f ; ok
; og ≔ g ; ok
≔ h ; of og

== Uniqueness Types ==

Specify a type of arrow that can not be split. This guarantees that only one copy of the value is in existance, which may be distructively updated.



== Other Thoughts ==

TODO: Proposed control instructions, can they all be converted to simpler contructions?
See wp:Control_flow
 - "Loop with test in the middle"
 - "Multiple early exit/exit from nested loops"

TODO: Loop cycle detection: Given a loop with initial state I and iterator L(I) ↦ I'. Simultaniously compute two copies of the loop, one iterating twice as fast the other. If the two returned states are equal the loop is infinite.

TODO: Perhaps allow multiple different return paths from functions. Suppose a function could either return the answer or an error. Both would have a different return type, but conventional multi valued function definition require the number (and type) if values to be fixed. This can be resolved by having multiple return paths, each with different types and different control flow in the calling body. This is simmilar (and could be implemented as) continuation-passing-style with multiple continuations.
